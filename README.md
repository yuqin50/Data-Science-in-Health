## About the course
Data Science is a rapidly growing, interdisciplinary field that enables practitioners to glean insights from various forms of data. This course aims to teach the fundamentals of data science, as well as introduce you to some of the tools that enable modern data science. We will cover the full cycle of data science, including:

    - Asking appropriate questions/Generating hypotheses
    - Extracting raw data
    - Performing cleaning, reshaping, and exploratory data analysis
    - Statistical and Machine Learning Models
    - Assessing model results
    - Reporting on results in reproducible fashion
    - Presenting results verbally to an audience
## The Goals
The goal of this course is for students to learn the tools needed to succeed in a modern data science environment. We will cover some topics at a high-level, focusing on building intuition, as well as dive into some important topics in detail. By the end of the course, students should be able to take a data science project from asking the right questions, through the data processing and modeling, and into a concise and well-delivered presentation that highlights their work. Practical skills that will be taught include:

    - Data Science Programming (Python)
    - Data Visualization (Seaborn, matplotlib)
    - Literate Programming (Jupyter Notebooks)
    - Software Containerization (Docker)
    - Modeling (Scikit-learn)
    - Delivering effective presentations
